						<p>
						Poverty, it is a social issue that can be found almost anywhere in our country. Families of six to
						eight have only one meal a day consisting of two slices of fish, and three cups of rice. Poverty, however, is
						such a small problem yet our country still has a hard time getting over it. Many administrations have
						proposed several solutions, each with different approaches, but none worked the way they wanted.
						Most of you might have never heard the actual definition of this small problem so, what is poverty?
						Poverty, defined by Google Search , is the state of being extremely poor. This definition just goes to show
						how simple a problem it really is. The root of the problem is the fact that there are people that are extremely
						poor. Politicians and philosophers alike are just complicating everything and giving complex solutions to
						this problem that can be solved with such an easy solution.
						</p>
						<p>
						The solution I have in mind, Poor Execution, it is a simple and effective solution. All we must do is
						execute and eliminate all the extremely poor people. This solution has been proven to work by our own
						government’s war on drugs. Its effectiveness really was amazing, they immediately imprisoned anybody
						who tried to question their way of doing things. This way of doing things was so effective that in a span of
						two years, approximately 5000 drug users either died or just disappeared (SWS, 2019). It really was
						brilliant seeing these heroes at work. My way of thinking is that if it worked for our government’s war on
						drugs then it should work for poverty.
						</p>
						<p>
						It has two stages only, because it really is that simple. I also suggest that we do this yearly so that
						the cases of poverty do not inflate like they do now. Firstly, The Execution: All we must do is group the
						people between either elite or in poverty. We will then gather the people in poverty once a year, I suggest
						around the first week of either September or October. After gathering them we then start the execution.
						</p>
						<p>	
						Now, the “intellectuals” would come in with claims regarding human rights violations, so to satisfy
						their desires, we must choose a way of execution that is bloodless. The idea is to use toxic gas which can
						be easily produced based on research. This is a cost-efficient and easy way to eliminate these poor
						families. Now we have found a way to execute these poor families, but we have thousands of bodies with
						nowhere to put them.
						</p>
						<p>
						Lastly, The Disposal: The question from the previous paragraph comes up, where do we bury the
						bodies? It is scientifically proven that the decaying bodies of humans provide nutrients for trees and plants
						alike to grow healthily. There have been ton of forest fires within the past year like the Australia forest fires
						and the gender reveal incident. This would hasten the reforestation of the rainforest and other places
						around the world.
						</p>
						<p>
						After some research and deliberating, I can say that I have done something that could benefit my
						nation greatly. I have considered other solutions that politicians have proposed, and I believe they are all
						inferior to my proposal. Creating jobs, raising the minimum wage can all theoretically work, but it will be
						costly, and it will take a long time. We need solutions that are guaranteed to work and work almost
						immediately if we are going to solve this problem.
